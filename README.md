# My Emacs Configuration

This configuration automatically puts Emacs on the state I most enjoy so far.


## Compatibility

This configuration was built for Emacs 28.x and it should work on both
GUI-based and terminal-based versions of Emacs for Linux and MacOS X.

Windows aren't and won't be supported.


## Installation

Just clone this package to `~/.emacs.d` and start your Emacs. At that point,
it should start downloding all the missing packages.

This operation might take a few minutes to complete. Patience is a virtue!
